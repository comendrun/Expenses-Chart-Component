- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript Charts (ChartJS)

### What I learned

in this Challenge i learned about a tool that helps to draw charts using JavaScript called ChartJS. it was a pretty usefull tool and the way that it works is pretty straight forward. its also highly customizable. the documentation is good and also there are lots of other resources an dvideos about it on the internet.
one of the videos i first watched for this library was from "Dev Ed" [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqARSwfsV9w), but there are also lots of other videos on youtube.
wish you all best of luck, it was fun learning about this new tool.

### Continued development

I put so much time on this, but i didnt find out how to change the label and title in tooltip section of the bars, so thats definetly something i would like to learn more about.
